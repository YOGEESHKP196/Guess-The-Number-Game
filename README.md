# Guess-The-Number-Game
A Number Guessing Game is a simple game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Using JavaScript, you can create this game by generating a random number, taking user input, and providing feedback like too high or too low.

Approach
Generate Random Number: A random number between 1 and 10 is generated using Math.random().
User Input Handling: The user inputs a guess through the text field and submits it by clicking the button.
Compare Guess: The user's guess is compared with the generated number to check if it's correct, higher, or lower.
Feedback via Alerts: Appropriate feedback is given through alerts based on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
Increment Guess Counter: The number of guesses is counted and incremented after each incorrect attempt.
